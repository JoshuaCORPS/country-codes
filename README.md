# lambdaS Coding Challenge üõ†

## Purpose

Hi and welcome to the lambdaS Coding Challenge. The purpose of this task is to get a sense for your technical ability and how you work with tools that are similar to what we currently use at lambdaS.

We want to see how well you build software and we are looking forward to chatting with you about your solution afterwards. We recommend you have a good look at the problem description before getting started.

We ask that you work on the solution by yourself and submit only your own code. This task shouldn‚Äôt take excessive time from your schedule, however we know people have busy weeks and if you need a weekend to work on this we understand.

When complete, please open a PR (Pull Request) from a newly created **develop** branch back to the **master** branch. We will review your implementation with you during a follow-up session.

## The Task

You are required to build a responsive web app (mobile | tablet | desktop) which will load a list of contries from an API and present them to Users, as illustrated in the following wireframe:

---

You can use any frameworks or libraries suitable for the task. You might be asked why you made certain choices during interview.

Don't worry if you feel as though some of this task is vague, it's been written that way intentionally so that you have the freedom to approach the task however you want.
